What is Graph Theory?
</h1>
<p>
Graph theory is a mathematical discipline that explores the properties and relationships of entities represented as nodes and the connections between them, known as edges, in structures called graphs. It provides a framework for analyzing and understanding the connectivity patterns in various systems and networks.

<h1>
What is a graph?
</h1>
<p>
In the context of graph theory, a graph is a mathematical representation of a set of objects where some pairs of the objects are connected by links, which are typically called edges. The objects are represented by vertices or nodes. A graph can be either directed or undirected, depending on whether the edges have a specific direction or not.
</p>
<h1>
Types of graphs
</h1>
<p>
Graphs can be broadly classified into two main types based on the nature of their edges: directed graphs (digraphs) and undirected graphs. Additionally, graphs may have specific characteristics or structures, leading to various subtypes. Here are some common types of graphs:
</p>
<p>
<strong>1. Directed Graph (Digraph): </strong>
In a directed graph, edges have a direction. That is, each edge connects an ordered pair of vertices, indicating a one-way relationship between them.

<p>
<strong>2. Undirected Graph:</strong>
 In an undirected graph, edges have no direction. The relationship between vertices is symmetric, meaning it goes both ways.

<p>
<strong>
3. Weighted Graph:
</strong>
A weighted graph assigns a numerical weight to each edge, representing some measure of distance, cost, or strength of the relationship between the connected vertices.

<p>
<strong>
4. Unweighted Graph: 
</strong>
In contrast to a weighted graph, an unweighted graph has no assigned numerical values to its edges.
<p>
<p>
<strong>
5. Cyclic Graph:
</strong>
A graph that contains at least one cycle, which is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex.

<p>
<strong>
6. Acyclic Graph:
</strong>
A graph that has no cycles. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are particularly important in various applications, such as task scheduling.
</p>

<p>
<strong>
7. Connected Graph:
</strong>
A graph is connected if there is a path between every pair of vertices. If a graph is not connected, it may consist of disconnected components.

<p>
<strong>
8. Complete Graph:
</strong>
 In a complete graph, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. An undirected complete graph has the maximum possible number of edges.
</p>

<p>
<strong>
9. Bipartite Graph: 
</strong>
A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other set.
</p>

<p>
<strong>
10. Tree: 
</strong>
A connected acyclic graph. A tree with a designated root is called a rooted tree.
